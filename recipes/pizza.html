        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pizza, at its core, is a savory flatbread dish, traditionally from Italy, made by baking a flattened dough base with various toppings. These toppings often include a tomato sauce, cheese (typically mozzarella), and a wide array of ingredients like vegetables, meats, or spices. The crust can be thin and crispy or thick and chewy, and the dish is usually enjoyed hot, often eaten without utensils
